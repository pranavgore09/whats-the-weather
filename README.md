Get history of weather for input city names.

### What it is
This is my first backbone appliation that actually does something :). It fetches weather history for cities.

### What is does
1. Accepts comman separated city names.
2. Fetches weather information from [openweathermap](http://openweathermap.org/API)
3. Displays it in tabular format
4. Every cell has more button, which shows history of that city for given date.

### How to use
1. Download the ZIP.
2. Extract it.
3. Run index.html (double click it).
4. Enter comma separated city names in the text field.
5. Click on "Get Weather".
6. Be patient and let the fetching finish.
7. Click on "More" button to get more information about the city weather for that particular day.
