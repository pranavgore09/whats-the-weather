### What it does
1. Accepts comma separated city names.
2. Fetches weather information from [openweathermap](http://openweathermap.org/API)
3. Displays it in tabular format
4. Every cell has "More" button, which shows history of that city for given date.

### How to use
1. Download the ZIP.
2. Extract it.
3. Run index.html (double click it).
4. Enter comma separated city names in the text field.
5. Click on "Get Weather".
6. Be patient and let the fetching finish.
7. Click on "More" button to get more information about the city weather for that particular day.
